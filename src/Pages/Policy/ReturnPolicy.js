        <p>Buyer can initiate the Refund Request if the Shipment is damaged and detected after the delivery ("Damaged Shipment"). For the Return Request for Damaged Shipment:</p>
        <p>
          • The Buyer shall raise a Return Request within 10 (ten) days from the date of delivery.<br />
          • At the time of making a Return Request to our customer support team, the Buyer will be required to provide appropriate supporting documentation/proof including but not limited to images and videos of the damaged goods, copy of bill and tax invoice.<br />
          • We will assign the reverse pickup of the Product and once the Product is returned to our facility at no cost to the Buyer, we will initiate an inspection of the Shipment within 48 (forty eight) hours of pick up to confirm the damage. If damage is confirmed, confirmation will be sent to the Buyer acknowledging the return process.<br />
          • The refund process will begin once the returned Shipment has been inspected and deemed valid for return due to damage. If the Buyer is a credit Buyer, the refund amount will be adjusted against any outstanding credit or dues owed to us and if there is no credit then/after the refund amount will be credited to Buyer's bank account.<br />
          • If the product do not match the reverse pickup (RVP) details, udaan will not approve return request.
